# ReDI_Spring_DataScience_2021_Final_Project

This projects aims at developing  Artificial Neural networks (ANN) and Linear regression(LR) models for predicting solar photovoltaic energy output, using timeseries weather variables as input and the solar energy as target.

The Mbita WeTu Solar hub, a roof top solar PV system in Kisumu, Kenya is used as the case study off-grid solar PV system in this project.

Weather and solar energy data of the PV system from 01/01/2020 to 31/ 01/2020, has been collected from Solcast.com and the MATLAB Simulink model of the 30kWp system respectively.

The training data set, made up of 8670 data points of weather and power output in hourly frequency have been divided into two parts in which 70% is allocated for training, 30%  for testing. The mean squared error (MSE), r-squared (R^2), have been  used to evaluate the performance of the models.
